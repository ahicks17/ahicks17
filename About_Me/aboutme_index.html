<p>Hello all! My name is Austin just like the city! I am 25 years old and grew up here in beautiful Central Oregon.
I have spent allot of time trying to figure out what I want to do with my life and I finally figured it out! I am going to be a software engineer.
I have been obssesed with technology for basically my whole life. For the past two years I have been pretty serious about school and have been loving it! 
Some of my favorite subjects are:
</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Math!</li>
    <li>Sociology</li>
    <li>Computer Science</li>  
</ul>
<p> Some other things I enjoy are electronic dance music, hiking (really anything outdoors), and meeting new people.</p>
